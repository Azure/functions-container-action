# GitHub Actions for deploying customized Azure Functions image

With the Azure Functions GitHub Action, you can automate your workflow to deploy [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) in a customized image.

Get started today with a [free Azure account](https://azure.com/free/open-source)!

The repository contains a GitHub Action to deploy your customized function app image into Azure Functions. If you are looking for a simple GitHub Action to deploy your function app without building a customized image, please consider using [functions-action](https://github.com/Azure/functions-action).

The definition of this GitHub Action is in [action.yml](https://github.com/Azure/functions-container-action/blob/master/action.yml).

# End-to-End Workflow

## Dependencies on other GitHub Actions
* [Checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) Checkout your Git repository content into GitHub Actions agent.
* [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login) Login with your Azure credentials for function app deployment authentication.

## Azure Service Principle for RBAC
Create an [Azure Service Principal for RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) and add it as a [GitHub Secret in your repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables).
1. Download Azure CLI from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest), run `az login` to login with your Azure credentials.
2. Run Azure CLI command
```
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor \
                            --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{app-name} \
                            --sdk-auth

  # Replace {subscription-id}, {resource-group}, and {app-name} with the names of your subscription, resource group, and Azure function app.
  # The command should output a JSON object similar to this:

  {
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    (...)
  }
```
3. Paste the json response from above Azure CLI to your GitHub Repository > Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret > **AZURE_CREDENTIALS**

## Setup Container Registry Credentials
1. Paste your container registry username (e.g. docker hub username) to your GitHub Repository > Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret > **REGISTRY_USERNAME**
2. Paste your container registry password (e.g. docker hub password) to your GitHub Repository > Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret > **REGISTRY_PASSWORD**
3. (Optional) Create a new repository under your registry namespace (e.g. docker.io/mynamespace/myrepository)

## Create Azure function app and Deploy to function app container using GitHub Actions
1. Follow the tutorial [Create a function on Linux using a custom image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-function-linux-custom-image)
2. Customize your Dockerfile to ensure the function app dependencies can be resolved properly on runtime (e.g. npm install)
3. Use the [linux-container-functionapp-on-azure.yml](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/tree/master/FunctionApp/linux-container-functionapp-on-azure.yml) template as a reference, create a new workflow.yml file under your project `./github/workflows/`
4. Commit and push your project to GitHub repository, you should see a new GitHub Action initiated in **Actions** tab.

Azure Functions GitHub Action for deploying customized Azure Functions image is supported on both 'AzureUSGovernment' or 'AzureChinaCloud'.Login to the respective Azure Cloud before running this Action using [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login)
